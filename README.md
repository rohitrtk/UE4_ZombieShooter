# UE4_ZombieShooter

<p>
  This is more or less my first 'finished' game in Unreal Engine. 
</p>
<p>
  Players objective is to survive as long as possible,
  killing zombies in order to progress rounds and gain score points. Score points don't really do anything right now, they're
  just a symbol of how far the player has progressed in the game.
